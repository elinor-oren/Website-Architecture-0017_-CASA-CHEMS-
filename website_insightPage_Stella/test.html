    <div class="case-study">
      <p>Location: Camden, London, United Kingdom</p>
      <p>Challenges Faced: Camden formally declared a climate and ecological emergency in October 2019.</p>
      <p>Description: There is a clear desire from the community for more tree planting as a way to help address the climate and ecological emergency the world faces. To make the best use of the resources the council has, the strategy seeks to target tree planting in areas where an increase in canopy cover will provide the greatest benefits to residents. The council cannot increase canopy cover on public land alone and will need private homeowners, businesses and developments to plant trees on their land as well. </p>
      <p>Goals and actions: <p>1. council aims to increase the canopy cover by a minimum of 3.7% by 2045.</p>  
      <p></p>2. Increase tree diversity in Camden to have a tree stock resilient to pests, disease and climate change.</p>
      <P>3. Better recording system of tree planting in the borough.</P>
      <p>4. Minimise the potential of new pest and diseases entering the borough; </p>

      <blockquote>
        "London'S happiest borough is also one of its greenest, with new research suggesting there is a direct correlation between the two. Along with Barnet and Camden, the district has a tree cover rate of more than 26 per cent, according to National Tree Map data, with it ranked second in the whole of the UK on Rightmove's most recent survey. It shows the importance of trees on our mental well-being with the two sets of data showing a strong positive correlation between canopy cover and happiness. "
